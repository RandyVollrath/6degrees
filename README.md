# 6 degrees of Kanye West

This is the 6 degrees of Kanye West. It takes the concept of the 6 degrees of Kevin Bacon and applies it to Kanye West. F

For example, Kanye West performed "Niggas in Paris" with Jay-Z. Therefore, Jay-Z is seperated from Kanye by 1 degree.

I'm using the Rap Genius API for song data and Neo4j as the database. 

I've got 1 degree of seperation right now. Working to make this code I have into a recursive function that will break at 6 degrees.

Any comments/suggestions/help is totally welcome! Feel free to e-mail me: RandyVollrath@gmail.com
